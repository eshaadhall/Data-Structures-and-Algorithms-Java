Hello,

My name is Eshaa Dhall. I'm a 2015 Masters graduate in computer science from Temple University. I'm looking for an entry level software engineer role.

Post graduation, I have been working as a business and software analyst at eClinicalWorks, a leading cloud based EHR (electronic health records) systems company.

My current role is more customer facing with focus on training and testing using tools like JIRA. My responsibilities include traveling to various hospitals/clinics to setup the system and train the hospital staff of 5-30 individuals in various aspects of eClinicalWorks EHR software. I'm also responsible for on-site customization of the software based on user inputs and specific hospital/clinic requirements. Many times, I also plays the role of a product manager interfacing between the development team and client needs.

After 1 year of work at eClinicalWorks, I'm now actively looking for software engineering and development roles. I have a strong analytical background and I want to build my career in a technical role that allows me to leverage my academic training and passion for programming.
I'm currently on my H1-B visa which started October 2016.



Thank you once again.

Warm regards,
Eshaa
